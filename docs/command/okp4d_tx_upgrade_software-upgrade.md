### Options

```
  -a, --account-number uint      The account number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --authority string         The address of the upgrade module authority (defaults to gov)
      --aux                      Generate aux signer data instead of sending a tx
  -b, --broadcast-mode string    Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async) (default "sync")
      --chain-id string          The network chain ID
      --daemon-name string       The name of the executable being upgraded (for upgrade-info validation). Default is the DAEMON_NAME env var if set, or else this executable (default "okp4d")
      --deposit string           The deposit to include with the governance proposal
      --dry-run                  ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but don't broadcast it (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
      --fee-granter string       Fee granter grants fees for the transaction
      --fee-payer string         Fee payer pays fees for the transaction instead of deducting from the signer
      --fees string              Fees to pay along with transaction; eg: 10uatom
      --from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
      --gas string               gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate sufficient gas automatically. Note: "auto" option doesn't always report accurate results. Set a valid coin value to adjust the result. Can be used instead of "fees". (default 200000)
      --gas-adjustment float     adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate returned by the tx simulation; if the gas limit is set manually this flag is ignored  (default 1)
      --gas-prices string        Gas prices in decimal format to determine the transaction fee (e.g. 0.1uatom)
      --generate-only            Build an unsigned transaction and write it to STDOUT (when enabled, the local Keybase only accessed when providing a key name)
  -h, --help                     help for software-upgrade
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory) (default "os")

      --no-checksum-required     Skip requirement of checksums for binaries in the upgrade info
      --no-validate              Skip validation of the upgrade info (dangerous!)
      --node string              <host>:<port> to CometBFT rpc interface for this chain (default "tcp://localhost:26657")
      --note string              Note to add a description to the transaction (previously --memo)
