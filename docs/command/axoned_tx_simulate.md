## axoned tx simulate

Simulate the gas usage of a transaction

### Synopsis

Simulate whether a transaction will be successful:

- if successful, the simulation result is printed, which includes the gas
  consumption, message response data, and events emitted;
- if unsuccessful, the error message is printed.

The user must provide the path to a JSON-encoded unsigned transaction, typically
generated by any transaction command with the --generate-only flag. It should
look like below. Note that the "signer_infos" and "signatures" fields are left
empty; they will be auto-populated by dummy data for simulation purpose.

\{
  "body": \{
    "messages": [
      \{
        "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
        "from_address": "cosmos1...",
        "to_address": "cosmos1...",
        "amount": [
          \{
            "denom": "utoken",
            "amount": "12345"
          \}
        ]
      \}
    ],
    "memo": "",
    "timeout_height": "0",
    "extension_options": [],
    "non_critical_extension_options": []
  \},
  "auth_info": \{
    "signer_infos": [],
    "fee": \{
      "amount": [],
      "gas_limit": "200000",
      "payer": "",
      "granter": ""
    \},
    "tip": null
  \},
  "signatures": []
\}

The --from flag is mandatory, as the signer account's correct sequence number is
necessary for simulation.

```
axoned tx simulate /path/to/unsigned-tx.json --from keyname [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --account-number uint         The account number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --aux                         Generate aux signer data instead of sending a tx
  -b, --broadcast-mode string       Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async) (default "sync")
      --chain-id string             The network chain ID (default "axoned")
      --dry-run                     ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but don't broadcast it (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
      --fee-granter string          Fee granter grants fees for the transaction
      --fee-payer string            Fee payer pays fees for the transaction instead of deducting from the signer
      --fees string                 Fees to pay along with transaction; eg: 10uatom
      --from string                 Name or address of private key with which to sign
      --gas string                  gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate sufficient gas automatically. Note: "auto" option doesn't always report accurate results. Set a valid coin value to adjust the result. Can be used instead of "fees". (default 200000)
      --gas-adjustment float        adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate returned by the tx simulation; if the gas limit is set manually this flag is ignored  (default 1)
      --gas-prices string           Gas prices in decimal format to determine the transaction fee (e.g. 0.1uatom)
      --generate-only               Build an unsigned transaction and write it to STDOUT (when enabled, the local Keybase only accessed when providing a key name)
  -h, --help                        help for simulate
      --keyring-backend string      Select keyring's backend (os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory) (default "test")
      --keyring-dir string          The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
      --ledger                      Use a connected Ledger device
      --node string                 <host>:<port> to CometBFT rpc interface for this chain (default "tcp://localhost:26657")
      --note string                 Note to add a description to the transaction (previously --memo)
      --offline                     Offline mode (does not allow any online functionality)
  -o, --output string               Output format (text|json) (default "json")
  -s, --sequence uint               The sequence number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --sign-mode string            Choose sign mode (direct|amino-json|direct-aux|textual), this is an advanced feature
      --timeout-duration duration   TimeoutDuration is the duration the transaction will be considered valid in the mempool. The transaction's unordered nonce will be set to the time of transaction creation + the duration value passed. If the transaction is still in the mempool, and the block time has passed the time of submission + TimeoutTimestamp, the transaction will be rejected.
      --timeout-height uint         DEPRECATED: Please use --timeout-duration instead. Set a block timeout height to prevent the tx from being committed past a certain height
      --tip string                  Tip is the amount that is going to be transferred to the fee payer on the target chain. This flag is only valid when used with --aux, and is ignored if the target chain didn't enable the TipDecorator
      --unordered                   Enable unordered transaction delivery; must be used in conjunction with --timeout-duration
  -y, --yes                         Skip tx broadcasting prompt confirmation
