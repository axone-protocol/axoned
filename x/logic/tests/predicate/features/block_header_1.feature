  Scenario: Retrieve the header of the current block.
    This scenario demonstrates how to retrieve the header of the current block and obtain some of its properties.

    The header of a block carries important information about the state of the blockchain, such as basic information (chain id, the height,
    time, and height), the information about the last block, hashes, and the consensus info.

    The header is represented as a Prolog Dict, which is a collection of key-value pairs.

    Given a block with the following header:
      """ yaml
      app_hash: Q0P6b2hoSUbmpCE6o6Dme4H4FBWqdcpqo89DrpBYSHQ=
      chain_id: axone-localnet

  Scenario: Evaluate a condition based on block time and height
    This scenario demonstrates how to evaluate a condition that depends on both the block time and block height.
    Specifically, it checks whether the block time is greater than 1709550216 seconds (Monday 4 March 2024 11:03:36 GMT)
    or the block height is greater than 42.
