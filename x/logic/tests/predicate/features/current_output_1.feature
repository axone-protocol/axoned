  This scenario demonstrates how to write a character to the current output, and get the content in the response of the

  Scenario: Write characters to the current output (with limit)
  This scenario demonstrates the process of writing characters to the current user output, with a limit configured
  in the logic module. So if the message is longer than this limit, the output will be truncated.

  Scenario: Write UTF-8 character to the current output (with limit)
  This scenario illustrates the impact of UTF-8 characters on output limits measured in bytes, not character count.
  Characters such as emojis require more space; for example, the wizard emoji (ðŸ§™) occupies 4 bytes, effectively counting
  as four units. As a result, the limit is reached more quickly with these characters, which means that the number of
  characters in the user output is less than expected.

  Scenario: Write strings to the current output (no limit configured)
  This scenario demonstrates that if no limit is configured in the logic module, the user can write as much as they want.
