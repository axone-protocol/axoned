> `Axone` is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed for connecting, sharing, and monetizing any resources in the AI stack. It is an open network dedicated to collaborative AI workflow management that is universally compatible with any data, model, or infrastructure. Data, algorithms, storage, compute, APIs... Anything on-chain and off-chain can be shared.

## The protocol

`axoned` is the node of the [AXONE](https://axone.xyz) network built on the [Cosmos SDK] üí´ & [Tendermint] consensus, which allows companies & individuals to define on-chain rules, share any off-chain resources & create a new generation of applications on top of them.

- üìñ Read the [introduction blog post](https://blog.axone.xyz/) to understand the project‚Äôs vision.
- üß† Explore the [white paper](https://docs.axone.xyz/docs/whitepaper/abstract) for a deeper look at the protocol architecture and network economics.

## Want to become a validator?

Validators are responsible for securing the axone network. Validator responsibilities include maintaining a functional [node](https://docs.axone.xyz/docs/nodes/run-node) with constant uptime and providing a sufficient amount of $AXONE as stake. In exchange for this service, validators receive block rewards and transaction fees.

## Supported platforms

The `axoned` blockchain currently supports the following builds:

| **Platform** | **Arch** |       **Status**       |
| ------------ | -------- | :--------------------: |
| Darwin       | amd64    |           ‚úÖ           |
| Darwin       | arm64    |           ‚úÖ           |
| Linux        | amd64    |           ‚úÖ           |
| Linux        | arm64    |           ‚úÖ           |
| Windows      | amd64    | Ô∏èüö´<br/> Not supported |

> Note: as the blockchain depends on [CosmWasm/wasmvm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm), we only support the targets
> supported by this project.

## Releases

All releases can be found [here](https://github.com/axone-protocol/axoned/releases).

`axoned` follows the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) to determine when and how the version changes, and
we also apply the philosophical principles of [release early - release often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often).

## Install

### From release

```sh
curl https://i.jpillora.com/axone-protocol/axoned! | bash
```

### From source

```sh
make install
```

### Using docker

```sh
docker run -ti --rm axoneprotocol/axoned --help
```

## Developing & contributing

`axoned` is written in [Go] and built using [Cosmos SDK]. A number of smart contracts are also deployed on the
AXONE blockchain and hosted in the [axone-protocol/contracts](https://github.com/axone-protocol/contracts) project.

### Prerequisites

- install [Go] `1.24+` following instructions from the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install);
- use [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) as formatter. You can integrate it in your favorite IDE following these [instructions](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#installation) or invoke the makefile `make format-go`;
- verify that [Docker] is properly installed and if not, follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com) for your environment;
- verify that [`make`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make) is properly installed if you intend to use the provided `Makefile`.

This Makefile depends on docker. To install it, please follow the instructions:
- for macOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
- for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```

### Build

To build the `axoned` node, invoke the goal `build-go` of the `Makefile`:

```sh
make build-go
```

The binary will be generated under the folder `target/dist`.

### Build a docker image

This project leverages [heighliner](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner) to simplify the management and
creation of production-grade container images. To build a Docker image, use the `build-docker` target in the `Makefile`:

```sh
make build-docker
```

### Run a local network

To initialize a local network configuration, invoke the goal `chain-init` of the `Makefile`:

```sh
make chain-init
```

The node home directory will be generated under the folder `target/deployment/localnet`. The configuration contains a single validator node.

To start the network, invoke the goal `chain-start` of the `Makefile`:

```sh
make chain-start
```

A wallet is preconfigured with some tokens, you can use it as follows:

```sh
axoned --home target/deployment/localnet tx bank send validator [to_address] [amount]
```
